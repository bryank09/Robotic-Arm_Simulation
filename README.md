# About the Project
With Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) emerged, we can harness the functionality offered by them to enhance user experience when designing an application. In this project, those technology was used to develop a Robotic Arm Simulation Application. Through this application, users will be able to simulate the operations of a robotic arm, such as picking up objects and moving them to desired destination. 

This project mainly focus on achieving these 3 objectives,
- Simulate a real world operation of a Robotic Armature movement inside Unity.
- Saving the degree of freedom (DOF) or rotational points of the Robotic Armature on a series of task.
- Generate an immersive and user-friendly procedure during simulation.

By creating a simulation that doesn't need any component or tools, industrial activities that involves a robotic armature could be evaluated and tested of their possible action.
